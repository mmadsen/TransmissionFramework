What is the model class doing today?

- initializeModel
	building trait dimensions, trait factory, and observers in code
	attaching observers to their objects -- right now, trait dimensions
	building the rule stack in code
	initializing the starting variation in each trait dimension (by constructing traits)
	building the initial model population and assigning initial variants (through adoption)


- parseCLOptions
	parses each command line switch in code, using the Apache commons library
	initializes a GlobalModelConfiguration object, to hold all the data so other classes can get to it through the model

- modelStep
	Other than CL switches, this seems to contain most of the "model specific" code, in the sense that it covers how we step through the population (i.e., WF or Moran updating).

- modelObservations
	fully generic, could be part of AbstractSimModel

- modelFinalize
	fully generic, could be part of AbstractSimModel
