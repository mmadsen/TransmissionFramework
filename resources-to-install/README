Currently, as of July 2010, the atunit-1.0.1 library isn't in a central Maven
repository.  So before building, you need to install it in a local repository.

From this directory, here is the command to do so.

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=atunit-1.0.1.jar -DgroupId=com.google.code
-DartifactId=atunit -Dversion=1.0.1 -Dpackaging=jar
